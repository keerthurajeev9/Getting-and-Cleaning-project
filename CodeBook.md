## Download the dataset
The dataset is downloaded from the specified url.

## Assign each data to variables
features <- features.txt 
List of activities carried out.
Activity <- activity_labels.txt 
The recorded features test data.
Test_X <- test/X_test.txt 
The test dataset of the code labels of activities
Train_Y <- test/y_test.txt 
The test data of 9/30 people under observation
SubjectTest<- test/subject_test.txt 
The test data of 21/30(remaining) people under observation
SubjectTrain <- test/subject_train.txt
The train data
Test_X <- test/X_train.txt 
The train dataset of the code labels of activities
Train_X <- test/y_train.txt

## Merging the test and training dataset to create a single dataset.
X_Fin is created by merging Train_X and Test_X using  the function rbind().
Similarly,Y_Fin is created by merging Train_Y and Test_Y the function rbind() 
SubjectFin is generated by merging SubjectTrain and SubjectTest using the function rbind().
Combine is generated by merging SubjectFin, YFin and XFin.

## Finds out the mean and standard deviation
TData  is generated by subsetting Combine and find the mean and standard deviation for each measurement by selecting subject and value.

## Summarize and exporting
The TidyDataFinal is generated by grouping them using subjects and act and finally summarize the data by taking the mean.
Write the TidyDataFinal into TidyDataFinal.txt
